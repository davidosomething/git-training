## Step 3 ##
Clone the training repository.
The training repository is on GitHub here:

There's a text bar on that page with a git address:

Copy it and, in your terminal, clone the repository.
Clone it into wherever you do your local web development, it'll create a
new folder (Arnold-git-training)
