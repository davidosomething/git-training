Arnold Worldwide git and GitHub training
========================================

This is the readme file in markdown format.

## Step 1: Sign up ##
*Once you've done this step, you never have to do it again!*

Sign up on github.com if you havenâ€™t already. You can use your personal
email address, but add your Arnold address too (click the wrench icon in
the top right and go to the Email Addresses section).

If you're already on github (and added your Arnold email as described above),
continue to step 1a.

### Step 1a: Join the organization ###
*Once you've done this step, you only have to do it again if joining another
github organization, e.g. a vendor's org)*

Request to join the ArnoldWorldwide organization.
Go to:

> https://github.com/ArnoldWorldwide/git-training/issues/1

and post a message to the thread.

## Step 2: Install and configure git on your computer ##
*You only have to do this once per computer.*

Download git, create an SSH key, connect your computer to github. You only
need to do this once per computer so just follow the appropriate guide
below, call me over if you need help.

* OSX -- http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/
* Win -- http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/

## Step 3: Fork the repository ##
*You will do this for every git repository you work on if it's on GitHub*
